# Gauges

A gauge, in science and engineering, is a device used to make measurements or in order to display certain dimensional information. A wide variety of tools exist which serve such functions, ranging from simple pieces of material against which sizes can be measured to complex pieces of machinery.Here in Flutter you can use this package to plot a machinery information effortlessly.

### Features

1. LinerGauge

### Getting started

Run this command

```

$flutter pub add geekyants_flutter_gauges

```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```
dependencies:
  geekyants_flutter_gauges: ^0.0.5
```

### Usage

Import it inside your main.dart

```
import 'package:geekyants_flutter_gauges/gauges.dart';

```

Use it as below

```dart
class _MyGaugeExampleState extends State<MyGaugeExample> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: SizedBox(
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
          child: const LinearGauge(
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
